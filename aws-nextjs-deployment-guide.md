# AWS Next.js Deployment Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of deploying Next.js applications on AWS. It covers various deployment options, including using AWS Amplify, Amazon EC2, and AWS Lambda with the Serverless Framework.

## Prerequisites
- AWS account
- Node.js installed
- Basic knowledge of Next.js

## Deployment Options
### 1. Using AWS Amplify
AWS Amplify provides a simplified deployment process for web applications.

#### Steps:
